=clinisift= is a multitool for processing clinical medical records.

The main goal is to provide easy, off-the-shelf access to *common NLP processes* when working with medical records:
- *Sentence Tokenization* and *Section Identification* from unstructured clinical textual data
- *Named Entity Recognition* of medication-related data and clinical entities from records
- *Intuitive visualization* of extracted information

Some motivating examples that can be accomplished in only a few lines of code to illustrate possible use-cases:
- Extract clinical problems and procedures mentioned in a record's CLINICAL HISTORY section.
- When exploring a new dataset, visualize records with clinical and medication entities parsed and highlighted on-the-fly.
- Check if both a particular medication and particular surgical procedure are mentioned in a patient's PAST MEDICAL HISTORY.


** Quick Features
- *Parse* - Extract clinical and medical entities through Transformers-based Named Entity Recognition, as well as other components like medical record section identification. Also supports any NER model that can be loaded as a HuggingFace pipeline
- *Analyze* - Built-in methods to quickly filter through parsed data with as little code overhead as possible.
- *Visualize* - spaCy-based visualizer that integrates with Transformers NER to visualize medical record parses on-the-fly, programmatically or via command line.

* Get Started
** Installation
Install via =pip=:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
pip install clinisift
#+END_SRC

Or, from source:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone git@github.com:clinisift/clinisift.git
cd clinisift && pip install -e .
#+END_SRC

* Quickstart
Below are some examples for common use-cases. A slightly longer overview of everything offered in =clinisift= is available in the Wiki.

** Extract all clinical entities and medications from a *.txt file
#+BEGIN_SRC python
from clinisift.cliniparse import Parser
from clinisift.doc import Doc

parser = Parser() # med ner and clinical ner
doc = Doc(text_file_path, parser)

res = doc.parse()
# { "sentences": [...],
# "entities": [...l, }
#+END_SRC


** Visualize entities extracted on-the-fly from a directory of .txt files
To launch a visualizer using the default Parser() config:

From the command line:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
python -m clinisift.visualizer /my/data/dir
#+END_SRC

A Flask server will be launched:

The visualizer module can be integrated with any `Parser` for more customizability about the NER pipelines used, entities visualized, and so forth. More information is available in the wiki.
